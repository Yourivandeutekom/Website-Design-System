<h1>Challenge: Website Design System</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>CodeCademy challenged me to create a Website design systeem. The challenge contains that I use all the information I read/learned in this full stack course.</p>
<h2>Project Goals</h2>
<p>In this project, I will be building my own basic design system for a website. In essence, I will be building a website to help me build MORE websites in the future! On my site, I will collect all the colors, fonts, and some of the repeating styles.</p>
